# PyBer: A Rideshare Analysis with Matplotlib
## Overview
PyBer is a ridesharing app that opperates in urban, suburban, and rural city types. As a new Data Analyst for PyBer, we were assigned to analyze the ride count, average fare per ride, and average number of drivers all categorized by sity type. In addition, we compared each city type's average ride fare to the total number of rides in that city type. We were provided `.csv` files for city data and ride data.

Now, our CEO, V. Isualize, has trusted Omar (our Manager) and I to create a summary DataFrame of ridesharing data by city type. We will be using Pandas and Matplotlib to make a multi-line graph that displays total weekly fares by city type over a few months.  
## Results
### Summary DataFrame:

As seen on the Summary DataFrame above, the Urban city type has the highest amount of rides (1,624) as well as the highest amount of total drivers (2,405) and total fares ($39,854). However, it also has the lowest fare per ride ($24.53) and the lowest average fare per driver ($16.57). For rural city type, it has the lowest amount of rides (125), the lowest amount of drivers (78), and the lowest amount of total fares ($4,327.93). In addtional, it has the highest average fare per ride ($34.62) and the highest fare per driver ($55.49). The suburban city type is in the middle for all categories with 625 total rides, 490 total drivers, $19,356.33 in total fares, $30.97 as the average fare per ride, and $39.50 as the average fare per driver.

In this multi-line graph we can better visualize the total fare by city type over the few months that data was collected. Urban city type has the highest total fare, suburban in the middle, and rural with the lowest.
 
## Summary
The Urban city type has the most total rides (1,625), however, it also has many more drivers than it has rides (2,405). Because there are less rides than drivers, the drivers may not have enough work to support themselves. These Urban drivers are also getting a significanlty less fare ($16.57/ride) compared to Rural drivers ($55.49). This could be due to the traveling distance in an Urban area being shorter than a Rural one, but we would need PyBer to test this theory by including mileage/distance data as part of the data collection and analysis. For the shortage of rides to drivers in Urban city types, PyBer may be interested in investing in advertisements around this area to gain new customers. They can create a rewards program or offer cool perks to first time PyBer users to ensure there are more than enough rides for drivers to accept. In addition, because the Rural city type has the highest average fare per ride ($34.62) which could be either due to the distance or the lack of enough drivers, Pyber can advertise their benefits for more drivers to join as ridesharers. This could lower the customer's fare and make Pyber more accesible to those who otherwise would not be able to afford it. To know the best times for advertising for new drivers and new PyBer users, Pyber could collect data (spanning over a year) to see when there are spikes in total fares by city type. With this information, our CEO V. Isualize, should be able to visualize her next decision.
