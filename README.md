# PyBer: A Rideshare Analysis with Matplotlib
## Overview
PyBer is a ridesharing app that opperates in urban, suburban, and rural city types. As a new Data Analyst for PyBer, we were assigned to analyze the ride count, average fare per ride, and average number of drivers all categorized by sity type. In addition, we compared each city type's average ride fare to the total number of rides in that city type. 

Now, our CEO, V. Isualize, has trusted Omar (our Manager) and I to create a summary DataFrame of ridesharing data by city type. We will be using Pandas and Matplotlib to make a multi-line graph that displays total weekly fares by city type over a few months.  
## Results
### Summary DataFrame:

As seen on the Summary DataFrame above, the Urban city type has the highest amount of rides (1,624) as well as the highest amount of total drivers (2,405) and total fares ($39,854). However, it also has the lowest fare per ride ($24.53) and the lowest average fare per driver ($16.57). For rural city type, it has the lowest amount of rides (125), the lowest amount of drivers (78), and the lowest amount of total fares ($4,327.93). In addtional, it has the highest average fare per ride ($34.62) and the highest fare per driver ($55.49). The suburban city type is in the middle for all categories with 625 total rides, 490 total drivers, $19,356.33 in total fares, $30.97 as the average fare per ride, and $39.50 as the average fare per driver.

In this multi-line graph we can better visualize the total fare by city type over the few months that data was collected. Urban city type has the highest total fare, suburban in the middle, and rural with the lowest.
